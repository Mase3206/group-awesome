                    Pluto is a dwarf planet found in the Kuiper Belt, a smaller body it is about half the 
                    width of about 2,2500 kilometers. 
                <li>
                    It is at a distance of around 3.6 billion kilometers from the Sun and has a highly eccentric orbit. Pluto's
                    orbit is also tilted at 17.1 degrees relative to the plane of the eliptic.

                    Though Neptune has the greatest effect on Pluto's orbit, Uranus can destabilize it. Meaning its orbit is 
                    unpredictable and maye escape the solar system at some point.
