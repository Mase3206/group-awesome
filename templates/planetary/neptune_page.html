                    Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and has the second lowest eccentric orbit, meaning
                    it is almost perfectly circular. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is located about 4.5 billion kilometers from the Sun.

                <li>
                    Beyond Neptun's orbit lies the Kuiper Belt, a region of dwarf planets, comets, and other icy objects.

                    Neptune's famous blue color is from the methane in its atmosphere.

                    Having the highest wind speeds in the solar system, Neptune's storms are some of 
                    the strongest and most violent. With some vortices being as wide as Earth. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 16 known moons, with Triton being the largest and oddly enough having a retrograde orbit.
